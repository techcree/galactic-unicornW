I have the following issue to solve. 
On the Pimoroni Galactic Unicorn.
We want to enter the text from a website that the display can then show. 
So I'm running Phew on the board's PicoW. 
Start the web server and make an entry via a website form. 
Then the text will be displayed on the Unicron. Works great so far. 

Now comes the problem. 
As soon as the script for the display runs, the web server is disconnected. 
So you can't make any more new entries. 
First the board has to be restarted. Really unhelpfull. 

I've already considered whether it could be solved with multi-core use. 
I think there must be a better way to keep the process open.

So we work on that. The Code Examples in this repositorie includes some parts of the code i use for but 
not the complete code you need. Phew an some other code and libaries is not included.
Most hat that or can find in other repositorie from me or a lot of other persons.

If you will help or have some questions you can send me a eMail.
